# zetamac-TTS

Quick and dirty replica of [zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/), however the arithmetic problem is spoken via a speech engine instead of displayed on screen. I found that mental arithmetic is more difficult for me when I'm unable to see the actual digits. Uses a simple TKInter GUI.
